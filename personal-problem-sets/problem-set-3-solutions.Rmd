This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


# 1(A) 
Let W be a binomial random variable with $n = 17$ and $p = 0.65$. What is the probability Pr( 9 <= W < 13)? (Hint: be careful about those inequalities!)

```{r}

sum(dbinom(9:13, 17, 0.65))
```

# 1(B) 
Let $X$ be  a  general normal  random  variable with $\mu=6.8$ and $\sigma^2=4.2$.  What is the value of the density function $f_X(5.7)$?
```{r}

pnorm(5.7, 6.8, 4.2)
```

# 1(C)
Let $Y$ be a chi-square random variable with 5 degrees of freedom. What is the survival probability $S_Y(8.6)$?
```{r}
dchisq(Y,df=4)
```

# 1(D)
Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable. What is the 75th percentile, $Q_Z(0.75)$?

```{r}

```
