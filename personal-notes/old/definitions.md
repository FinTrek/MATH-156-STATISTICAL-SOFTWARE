- Gamma Function: is the area under the curve that was defined by the value of x that we selected.
    - Computed as:
        - First, we select a value for x.
        - The value of x defines a specific functional form for the integrand, which is now a function just of t.
        - Then we integrate the integrand over t, from 0 to âˆž.
